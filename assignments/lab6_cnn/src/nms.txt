(d.1) How does NMS work?
	NMS takes all detections, and recursively takes the detection with the highest confidence score (that hasn't been used or removed), and compares it with all other detections
	if another detection "intersection over union" is greater than the given threshold, it will assume they are the same detection and remove that detection from the list of
	detections. It will continue to do this until it has done a comparison with all detections, with each detection with the next highest confidence score. And then return the
	final list of "cleaned up" detections.

(d.2) How does NMS affect detections?
	It will limit the number of detections by removing repeated detections of seemingly the same object.

(d.3) What is one way that NMS can help detection performance?
	By showing only the single, most-confident detection of an object, based off of the threshold, you limit any issues that may come about with having multiple repeated 
	detections. It also makes detection much cleaner to visualize as you have less data points after removing detections with NMS.
	
	Although while researching this topic, I noticed that a study out of a Stanford student has a possible conclusion that NMS does not appear to improve the performance of YOLO.
	They state there should be more testing to confirm the conclusion, but it is an interesting idea seeing how different threshold algorithms affect different detection algorithms.

(d.4) What is one way that NMS can harm detection performance?
	NMS is a very cumbersome algorithm. Meaning that depending on the number of detections you have, it can significantly increase the amount of time your detections take.
	It also, depending on your threshold, has the ability to remove detections that may not be the same object, but are just overlapping significantly.
