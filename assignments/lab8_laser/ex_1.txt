Before Running:
	odom -> base_footprint
	broadcaster: /gazebo

After Running:
	map -> odom -> base_footprint -> base_link -> [caster_back_link, imu_link, base_scan, wheel_left_link, wheel_right_link]
	broadcaster: /turtlebot3_slam_gmapping, /gazebo, /robot_state_publisher

With the mapping.launch running, the robot is able to access more of it's publishers, including the left and right wheel, the motion information of the robot from imu,
instead of just having access to the position and angular/linear velocity of the robot as a whole. As well as the information of the map itself.
